*    Preprocess the file ? what about includes?
*    strip C /* and // comments

*    Generate a query string free in the output code after calling 
    QueryCLTrans

*    query variable should be upper case QUERY
*    result variable should be upper case RESULT
*    columns variable should be upper case COLUMNS
*    rowN -> ROWN
*    rowCount -> ROWCOUNT
*    columns -> COLUMNS

*    result is a res_t, not an int, and should probably be called
    something else.  

*    if (result) -> clarify to if (result != NULL) {

*    rowCount is the record count but also serves to return error
    numbers (if negative) and should probably be the 'RESULT' the
    programmer is looking for.

*    Special character escape select from fubar=t where t.str = '\''.

*    Count parens in expressions

*    Eliminate unnecessary levels of parens in generated code

*    Do not generate variables (COLUMNS) that are not used 

    Perform perfect indention of generated code

    create schema user;
    create table user.test ( 
	field1 varchar PRIMARY KEY,
	field2 varchar
    );

    insert into user.test ( field1, field2 ) VALUES ( 'key1', 'data1' );
