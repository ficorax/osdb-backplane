<UL>
    <P>
    The Backplane database implements a subset of SQL and one primary 
    datatype, a variable-length string.  This document provides a reference
    to all currently supported commands.
    <P>
    All Backplane SQL must be enclosed in a transaction and most commands
    must be terminated by a semi-colon, even when specified through the DSQL
    or RSQL command line interfaces.  All Backplane SQL transactions operate
    relative to a freeze timestamp (which defaults to the latest timestamp)
    and do not see changes made to the database by other entities after
    the specified timestamp.  In otherwords, a transaction always operates on
    a consistent view of the database.  When you commit a modifying 
    transaction, the commit will fail and the transaction must be retried
    if other entities made modifications that would alter any queries made
    during the transaction.   
    <P>
    The freeze timestamp tracks commits and commit failures.  If a commit 
    fails the default freeze timestamp for the next transaction or the
    retry is adjusted pass the conflict point.  If you were to use the 
    original freeze timestamp your transaction would simply fail again.
    If a commit succeeds the default freeze timestamp for the next 
    transaction is updated to make the contents of the previous commit
    available to the following transaction. 
    <P>
    This serialization may introduce performance penalties in a
    replicated system because it takes a quorum of replication peers (which
    is just one database if you have no replication peers) to agree to
    a new synchronization point.  You can reduce or avoid this penalty
    by doing more work within a modifying transaction... for example, by
    enclosing it in a larger modifying transaction that encompasses several
    sub-transactions.  You may also be able to reduce or avoid this
    penalty when you intend to run a large number of non-interdependant
    transactions.  When running non-interdependant transactions you can use
    the original freeze timestamp for each transaction (at least as long as
    you do not get a conflict) which allows the transaction to proceed without
    having to wait for the prior transaction to synchronize in the backend.
    <P>
    In <B>dsql</B> a transaction looks something like this:
    <UL>
	<P><PRE>
(test:?) begin;
Begin Transaction flags=0000
(test:?) select * FROM sys.tables;
1     'sys', 'repgroup', '000c', 'sys'
2     'sys', 'tables', '0008', 'sys'
3     'sys', 'schemas', '0004', 'sys'
> RESULT 3
(test:?) rollback;
Rollback Succeeded
	</PRE>
    </UL>
    <P>
    A transaction always starts with a <B>begin</B> and terminates with
    either a <B>rollback</B> or a <B>commit</B>.  Sub-transactions are
    fully supported but other entities accessing the database will have
    no visibility into any changes you make until the top-level transaction
    is committed.   Non-modifying transactions should use <B>beginro</B>
    instead of <B>begin</B>.
    <P>
    <UL>
	<P><PRE>
(test:?) beginro;
Begin Transaction flags=0001
(test:?) select * FROM sys.tables;
1     'sys', 'repgroup', '000c', 'sys'
2     'sys', 'tables', '0008', 'sys'
3     'sys', 'schemas', '0004', 'sys'
> RESULT 3
(test:?) rollback;
Rollback Succeeded
	</PRE>
    </UL>
</UL>
<P><H2><B>(II) SQL Reference</B></H2>
<P>
sql_statement:
<UL>
    <P><B>BEGIN</B> [ <B>SYNC</B> | <B>READONLY</B> | <B>STREAMING</B> | <I>timestamp</I> ]* ";"
    <BR><B>BEGINRO</B> [ <B>SYNC</B> | <B>STREAMING</B> | <I>timestamp</I> ]* ";"
    <BR><B>COMMIT</B> ";"
    <BR><B>ROLLBACK</B> ";"
    <UL>
	<P>
	These SQL commands represent transaction control.  All transactions
	must start with a <B>BEGIN[RO]</B> and terminate with a <B>COMMIT</B>
	or <B>ROLLBACK</B>.  You should use <B>BEGINRO</B> or 
	<B>BEGIN READONLY</B> when initiating any non-modifying transaction
	to improve performance.  Various keywords effecting the transaction
	may also be specified:
	<UL>
	    <P><B>SYNC</B> - This forces the transaction to synchronize
	    the freeze timestamp to the latest available from the 
	    database engine, or the specified timestamp, whichever is larger.
	    It is typically used in monitoring applications which would
	    otherwise just use the same freeze timestamp over and over again
	    (and thus never see any changes made to the database relative to
	    the first transaction).
	    <P><B>READONLY</B> - A read-only transaction allows the Backplane
	    database to optimize management of the transaction.
	    <P><B>STREAMING</B> - Normally the user interface library collects
	    all results from a SELECT prior to returning the first result,
	    which allows nested SELECTs to be trivially specified.  If your
	    query is expected to return millions of records this could run
	    your process out of memory.  If you specify STREAMING the results
	    from a SELECT are returned on demand.  You cannot nest queries
	    inside a streaming SELECT.
	    <P><I>timestamp</I> - Typically a 64 bit hex value
	    0xNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN representing a timestamp / transaction id.
	    If not specified the previous timestamp (possibly updated by
	    the previous transaction) will be used.  Remember, the Backplane
	    database is a historical database so you can issue queries as of
	    any date in the past that is held in the database.
	</UL>
	<P>
	All queries within a transaction see a consistent view of the 
	database as-of the freeze point, plus any modifications made locally
	within the transaction.  Changes made by other entities will not be
	visible and changes made within the transaction will not be visible
	to other entities until your top-level commit.  The Backplane database
	supports full transactional nesting.  Nested transactions may be 
	committed or rolled-back but will only become visible to other 
	entities when the top-level transaction commits.
	<P>
	Commits may fail due to conflicts.  For example, if transaction #1
	reads data record A and modifies data record B, and transaction #2
	modifies data record A, then transaction #1 may fail if transaction #2
	commits before transaction #1 can.  <B>The Backplane database uses
	infinitely fine-grained opportunistic locking to guarentee 
	transactional coherency.  A commit will fail if data accessed 
	by one transaction is modified by another transaction before the
	first transaction can commit.  Since no record locking occurs,
	neither transaction will stall.</B>  In a replicated system it is
	possible for all conflicting transactions to fail due to the
	selection of the quorum.  That is, there is no guarentee of at least
	one transaction successfuly committing in a conflict situation.  In
	a non-replicated system at least one transaction will always 
	successfuly commit in a conflict situation.  It is recommended that
	you retry commits which fail due to a conflict and that you introduce
	a small random delay prior to your retry.
    </UL>
    <P><B>INSERT INTO</B> <I>table_spec</I> "(" <I>column_name</I> [ "," <I>column_name</I> ]* ")" <B>VALUES</B> "(" <I>data</I> [ "," <I>data</I> ]* ")" ";"
    <UL>
	<P>
	Inserts a record into the database.  The Backplane RDBMS automatically
	generates a guard query to validate the record (check for duplicate
	keys and so forth).
    </UL>
    <P><B>DELETE FROM</B> <I>table_spec</I> <B>WHERE</B> <I>sql_exp</I> ";"
    <UL>
	<P>
	Delete zero or more records.   The Backplane RDBMS does not currently
	validate foreign key restrictions.

	[ <B>LIMIT</B> <I>integer</I> ]
	";"
    <UL>
	<P>
	Retrieve columns from a table or tables in the database according
	to the expression.  The Backplane RDBMS can execute arbitrary
	joins but they must currently be explicitly specified.  Complex
	joins or expressions may result in duplicate records being returned.
	Here are some examples:
	<UL>
	    <P>SELECT a.key, b.data FROM test.table1=a, test.table2=b WHERE
	    a.key = 'abc' AND a.key = b.key;
	    <P>SELECT a.key, b.data FROM test.table1=a, test.table1=b WHERE
	    a.key = 'abc' AND b.fubar = a.key;
	    <P>SELECT * FROM test.table;
	</UL>
	<P>
	The <B>HISTORY</B> command works like <B>SELECT</B> but returns all
	historical and current records in the database that match the 
	specified parameters.  For example, if you made 10 updates to a 
	particular record in the database <B>HISTORY</B> will return all
	10 records rather then just the current version of the record.
	To differentiate the records the programmer usually retrieves certain
	internal columns along with the record data.  The internal columns
	available are:
	<UL>
	    <P><B>__timestamp</B> - The transaction id representing when the
		record was committed.  The transaction id also doubles as a
		timestamp.  Each top-level transaction made to the Backplane
		database has a unique transaction id, even in a replicated
		environment.
	    <P><B>__vtid</B> - The virtual table id for the record.  This
		identifier consists of four hex digits.
	    <P><B>__userid</B> - The tracking id for the record (set by a
		low level C API call.  This field may be NULL).
	    <P><B>__opcode</B> - The opcode for the record.  The opcode
		is two hex digits representing:
		<UL>
		    <P><B>RHF_INSERT (0x01)</B> - An inserted record
		    <P><B>RHF_UPDATE (0x02)</B> - An updated record (may only follow a DELETE) 
		    <P><B>RHF_DELETE (0x04)</B> - A deleted record.
		</UL>
		<P>
		Additionally the <B>RHF_REPLICATED (0x08)</B> bit may be 
		set in the opcode indicating that the record was obtained
		from another peer or snapshot in the replication group.  This
		bit is typically only used for debugging purposes.
		<P>
		The <B>INSERT</B> SQL command generates a RHF_INSERT record.
		The <B>UPDATE</B> SQL command generates a RHF_DELETE record
		followed by a RHF_UPDATE record.  The <B>DELETE</B> SQL
		command generates a RHF_DELETE record.  For your purposes you
		can treat RHF_UPDATE the same as RHF_INSERT... that is, a
		delete and an insert occuring within the same transaction.
	    <P><B>__date</B> - The date the record was committed in 
		human-readable form.  The date is derived from the
		transaction id / timestamp.
	</UL>
    </UL>
    <P><B>COUNT</B> <B>FROM</B> <I>table_spec</I> [ "," <I>table_spec</I> ]*
	<B>WHERE</B> <I>sql_exp</I>
	[ <B>LIMIT</B> <I>integer</I> ]
	";"
    <UL>
	<P>
	Return the number of records that the query matches.
    </UL>
    <P><B>UPDATE</B> <I>table_spec</I> [ "=" <I>id</I> ] <B>SET</B>
	<I>column_name</I> "=" <I>data</I> [ "," <I>column_name</I> "=" <I>data</I> ]* <B>WHERE</B> <I>sql_exp</I> ";"
    <UL>
	<P>
	Update zero or more records matching the expression, setting the
	specified columns to the specified data.  The Backplane database will
	automatically generate internal guard queries to validate the update
	(check for duplicate keys and so forth).
    </UL>
    <P><B>CLONE</B> <I>table_spec</I> [ "=" <I>id</I> ] <B>SET</B>
	<I>column_name</I> "=" <I>data</I> [ "," <I>column_name</I> "=" <I>data</I> ]* <B>WHERE</B> <I>sql_exp</I> ";"
    <UL>
	<P>
	<B>CLONE</B> works exactly like <B>UPDATE</B> but (A) does not delete
	the record(s) being updated and (B) clones the column data from the
	original records into the new records plus the <B>SET</B> modifications
	you make to those columns.  The Backplane database will automatically
	generate internal guard queries to validate the update so generally
	speaking you must modify one or more primary keys in the record
	when cloning it to avoid a duplicate key error.
