    <P>
    <B>Note that we are currently recoding the C interface to be less 
    interdependant on other backplane libraries.  In particular, we are
    recoding the interface to integrate with pthreads environments
    much better.  The API calls will remain the same but we hope to reduce
    the number of #include's and link elements required.</B>
</UL>
<P><H2><B>(I) General build and link environment</B></H2>
<UL>
    <P>
    Integration of the Backplane database into a C application is accomplished
    primarily by linking against the <B>libclient</B> or <B>libpclient</B>
    libraries.   If you want to use Backplane's native threading support
    use <B>libclient</B>.  If you want to use pthreads use <B>libpclient</B>.
    Note that when using Backplane's native threading support you should
    use a <B>task_main()</B> entry point instead of a <B>main()</B> entry
    point.
    <P>
    If you are using Backplane's native threading support you must 
    also link in the Backplane libthreads and libsupport.  If you are using
    pthread support (i.e. you are using libpclient instead of libclient)
    you should only link in the Backplane libsupport.
    These libraries usually reside in <B>/usr/local/backplane/lib</B>.
    The proper C compile/link line would
    look something like this (see the <B>samples</B> directory, typically
    <B>/usr/local/backplane/samples</B>, for a working example).

    Transaction error codes are listed in
    <B>/usr/local/backplane/include/rdbms/errors.h</B>. 
    The two most common transaction errors are DBERR_COMMIT1_CONFLICT
    and DBERR_LOST_LINK.  The Backplane database will generate a commit1
    conflict if you attempt to commit a transaction whos queries depend on
    data in the database which has changed relative to the freeze time stamp
    you specified at the beginning of your query.  When a commit conflict
    occurs FTs will be adjusted to a timestamp just beyond the conflicting
    record and you can retry the transaction if you like.  We strongly
    recommend throwing in a small random delay prior to retrying.
    <P>
    It is fairly easy to to play around with commit conflicts.  All you
    need to do is run <B>dsql</B> on two terminals, <B>begin;</B> a
    transaction, and issue modifying transactions on both terminals
    which conflict with each other.
    <P>
    If the link to the local replicator is lost you have to close and
    reopen both the instance and the root database handle.
    <P>
    <B>When you are making a modifying transaction any UPDATEs or other changes
    you make within a transaction or subtransaction will be visible to
    other queries within the master transaction, but will NOT be visible
    to other transactions until you (A) commit and (B) the other transaction
    uses a freeze timestamp which is >= the commit timestamp.  It is 
    important to note in particular that modifications made in
    sub-transactions are left in temporary tables and aggregated into their
    parent transactions.  Those modifications are not visible outside 
    the master transaction until the master transaction is committed!</B>
</UL>
<P><H2><B>(III) Huge Transactions</B></H2>
<UL>
    <P>
    The Backplane database uses opportunistic locking to detect conflicts.
    This means that the backplane database must record queries made during
    a transaction.  This record cannot be deleted until the highest level
    transaction is committed or rolledback.  This record is not deleted
    when subtransactions (nested BEGINs) complete, which can mean trouble
    if you want to write a program which operates over thousands or millions
    of customer records (for example).
    <P>
    Lets say you need to do a massive update to all the customer records in
    a large database.  For example, lets say you are doing a billing run.
    Theoretically you could BEGIN a transaction and then operate on a
    million customer records before committing the transaction.  In reality
    you can't do this without running the Backplane daemons out of memory.
    You also don't really want to do this in a single transactions because
    you will likely touch huge portions of the database which means your
    final commit is likely to fail on a live system where other programs are
    also interacting and modifying the database.  The best way to solve 
    this sort of problem is to break the problem set up into two pieces:
    The first piece is responsible for scanning out the customer ids in the
    database, the second piece is responsible for doing the work on each
    customer id.  To avoid doing this in a nested transaction you can open up
    two independant database instances (e.g. DbI1 and DbI2 instead of just
    DbI).  The first instance would be used to scan the customer ids, the
    second instance would be used to perform the work on each customer id.
    Since the two instances are independant each transaction you do in the
    second instance will not be nested in the first but will instead
    be a top-level transaction, greatly reducing the possibility of a conflict
    occcuring.
</UL>
<P><H2><B>(III) Freeze Timestamp and READ-ONLY transactions</B></H2>
<UL>
    <P>
    The vast majority of database operations typically performed are
    non-modifying (read-only) transactions.  In the Backplane cursors 
    implementation you can use <B>BEGINRO</B> instead of <B>BEGIN</B>
    to denote a read-only transaction.  Using <B>BEGINRO</B> generates an
    implied <B>ROLLBACK</B> so you do not have to specify <B>ROLLBACK</B>
    to terminate your transaction (unless you want to use <B>ROLLBACK</B>
    to early-terminate a transaction).  Backplane does not bother to record
    queries in non-modifying transactions (but be careful: the toplevel
    transaction must be non-modifying for Backplane to not record queries in
    non-modifying sub-transactions!).  This means that you can perform
    an infinite number of queries within such transactions without having to
    worry about running the Backplane database out of temporary memory.
    <P>
    Additionaly, since the Backplane database is a historical database,
    data consistency within such transactions is maintained simply by using
    the same freeze time stamp.  The Backplane database does not need to
    maintain any record locks whatsoever.  You can guarentee data consistency
    by specifying the same freeze time stamp across multiple top-level
    transactions.
    <P>
    <B>Warning: if you do a modifying transaction and then do a second
    transaction that specifies a freeze timestamp for the database which is
    prior to the modifications, your queries in the second transaction will
    not see the modifications you made in the first!  The cursors 
    implementation automatically updates the freeze timestamp specified
    in the BEGIN clause when you make a modifying transaction.</B>  This
    feature can also be used to maintain consistency across separate program
    executions (such as separate CGI executions in a web interface) without
    having to maintain an active transaction or process between queries.
    <P>
    It should also be noted that the freeze timestamp is only used in the
    top-level BEGIN() sequence and will remain fixed at that value for any
    sub-transactions.  However, for current and future compatibility you
    should always specify the same freeze timestamp in any sub-transactions
    that you specified in the top-level transaction.
</UL>
<P><H2><B>(IV) Nested SELECTs</B></H2>
<UL>
    <P>
    The Backplane cursors implementation allows nested transactions and
    nested SELECTs within a transaction.   This is an extremely powerful
    mechanism that allows you to treat your SQL programs almost like 
    arbitrarily nestable subroutines.  To accomplish this, however, the
    cursors implementation collects all rows from a SELECT query before
    initiating the loop.  If you are making a SELECT which has the potential
    to return millions of records this data collection can run your process
    out of memory and you should consider using a <I>streaming</I> transaction
    to perform the SELECT.  The format for a streaming transaction is:
    <UL>
	<P><PRE>
BEGINRO(dbi, freezets, status) STREAMING { ... }
	</PRE>
    </UL>
    <P>
    <B>There are severe nesting limitiations within a streaming transaction!
    You cannot nest any SQL command or sub-transaction within a streaming
    SELECT because the cursors implementation collects the row results from
    the select on-demand and the instance link is not available for other
    commands.  In order to nest SQL commands within a streaming query you
    must use multiple database instances (e.g. DbI1 and DbI2 instead of DbI)
    and you must be fairly careful in regards to data consistency.</B>
    Streaming queries are primarily used in two situations:  (1) When you are
    dumping large amounts of data.  The Backplane <B>ddump</B> program 
    uses streaming queries, for example.  And (2) When you need to process 
    a large number of compartmentalizable entities, such as when you need to
    bulk-process a customer list and wish to update information for each
    customer.
</UL>
<P><H2><B>(V) ROLLBACKs and Commits</B></H2>
<UL>
    <P>
    A transaction is automatically committed if you fall-through the
    end-brace of a BEGIN { } sequence.  At any point within the transaction
    you can instead issue a <B>ROLLBACK;</B> sql command which will abort
    the current [sub]transaction and skip to the end of the nearest
    BEGIN's end-brace.  Rolling back a sub-transaction undoes any 
    modifications made within that transaction without undoing modifications
    made in the parent transaction(s).
    <P>
    Generally speaking you should use read-only transactions and
    sub-transactions (BEGINRO instead of BEGIN) for non-modifying
    operations whenever possible.  Non-modifying transactions only need
    to talk to one replicated copy of the database and do not need to
    record the queries for conflict resolution, whereas modifying 
    transactions must talk to at least a quorum (note 1) and must also
    record queries made during the transaction.
    <P>
    <I>note 1: The backplane database can be replicated, with any number
    of full peers and snapshots.  If you utilize the peer replication 
    capability of the database then modifying transactions must talk to
    at least a quorum of peers.  So, for example, if you have 3 peers and
    30 snapshots a modifying transaction would have to talk to at least 2
    of the peers.  A non-modifying transaction, on the otherhand, could
    operate to completion just by talking to one of the snapshots.</I>
